# 📊 Employee Performance and Retention Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes employee data to understand performance trends and predict employee attrition using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.

The objective is to apply statistics, probability, machine learning, and neural networks to derive actionable business insights for HR decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze employee performance trends
* Identify key factors contributing to attrition
* Build predictive models for:

  * Employee Attrition (Classification)
  * Employee Performance (Regression)
* Apply Deep Learning models using TensorFlow/Keras
* Generate actionable business recommendations

---

## 📂 Dataset Features

The dataset contains the following features:

* Employee ID
* Name
* Age
* Department
* Salary
* Years at Company
* Performance Score
* Attrition (Yes/No)

---

## 📊 Phase 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Descriptive Statistics (Mean, Median, Variance, Standard Deviation)
* Correlation Heatmap
* Pairplot Visualization
* Outlier Detection (Boxplots)
* Probability Analysis
* Bayes' Theorem Application
* Hypothesis Testing (ANOVA)

---

## 🤖 Phase 2 – Machine Learning Models

### 🔹 Employee Attrition Prediction

* Model: Random Forest Classifier
* Evaluation Metrics:

  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * F1-Score
  * Confusion Matrix

### 🔹 Employee Performance Prediction

* Model: Linear Regression
* Evaluation Metrics:

  * R² Score
  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)

---

## 🧠 Phase 3 – Deep Learning Models

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* Salary and Years at Company strongly influence performance.
* Employees with low performance scores show higher attrition risk.
* Certain departments demonstrate higher turnover.
* Early-career employees (0–2 years) are more likely to leave.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

* Department-wise performance improvement programs
* Targeted engagement strategies for new employees
* Performance-based incentive plans
* Salary restructuring for high-risk employee groups

---
